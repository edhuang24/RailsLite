# RailsLite

RailsLite is a lightweight version of Ruby-on-Rails built from scratch, featuring some of the basic functionality from Rails.

This particular construction includes a lightweight version of Active Record that includes model associations and table modification/lookup methods.

The goal of this project was to gain a thorough understanding of Ruby-on-Rails, Active Record, and backend frameworks in general.
